(153, 'Entertainment is a form of activity', 'Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but it is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience\'s attention.\r\n\r\nAlthough people\'s attention is held by different things because individuals have different preferences, most forms of entertainment are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, and developed into sophisticated forms over time, becoming available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products, to a banquet adapted for two, to any size or type of party with appropriate music and dance, to performances intended for thousands, and even for a global audience.\r\n\r\nThe experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire, for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears to be entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.\r\n\r\nAn important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of people watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant and audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performances, as in the case of theatre or concerts, or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children\'s games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion, as with stage magic. Films and video games, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.\r\n\r\nSome entertainment, such as public executions, is now illegal in most countries. Activities such as fencing or archery, once used in hunting or war, have become spectator sports. In the same way, other activities, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions, and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work or an act of cruelty by another.\r\n\r\nThe familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over into different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.', 5, '06 May, 2025', 3, '06-May-25-coderus-media-and-entertainment-technology-trends-2021.jpg'),
(154, 'Technology and Human Vulnerability', 'For most of the last 50 years, technology knew its place. We all spent a lot of time with technology—we drove to work, flew on airplanes, used telephones and computers, and cooked with microwaves. But even five years ago, technology seemed external, a servant. These days, what’s so striking is not only technology’s ubiquity but also its intimacy.\r\n\r\nOn the Internet, people create imaginary identities in virtual worlds and spend hours playing out parallel lives. Children bond with artificial pets that ask for their care and affection. A new generation contemplates a life of wearable computing, finding it natural to think of their eyeglasses as screen monitors, their bodies as elements of cyborg selves. Filmmakers reflect our anxieties about these developments, present and imminent. In Wim Wenders’s Until the End of the World, human beings become addicted to a technology that shows video images of their dreams. In The Matrix, the Wachowski brothers paint a future in which people are plugged into a virtual reality game. In Steven Spielberg’s AI: Artificial Intelligence, a woman struggles with her feelings for David, a robot child who has been programmed to love her.\r\n\r\nToday, we are not yet faced with humanoid robots that demand our affection or with parallel universes as developed as the Matrix. Yet we’re increasingly preoccupied with the virtual realities we now experience. People in chat rooms blur the boundaries between their on-line and off-line lives, and there is every indication that the future will include robots that seem to express feelings and moods. What will it mean to people when their primary daily companion is a robotic dog? Or to a hospital patient when her health care attendant is built in the form of a robot nurse? Both as consumers and as businesspeople, we need to take a closer look at the psychological effects of the technologies we’re using today and of the innovations just around the corner.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the smartest people in the field of technology are already doing just that. MIT and Cal Tech, providers of much of the intellectual capital for today’s high-tech business, have been turning to research that examines what technology does to us as well as what it does for us. To probe these questions further, HBR senior editor Diane L. Coutu met with Sherry Turkle, the Abby Rockefeller Mauzé Professor in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society at MIT. Turkle is widely considered one of the most distinguished scholars in the area of how technology influences human identity.\r\n\r\nFew people are as well qualified as Turkle to understand what happens when mind meets machine. Trained as a sociologist and psychologist, she has spent more than 20 years closely observing how people interact with and relate to computers and other high-tech products. The author of two groundbreaking books on people’s relationship to computers—The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit and Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet—Turkle is currently working on the third book, with the working title Intimate Machines, in what she calls her “computational trilogy.” At her home in Boston, she spoke with Coutu about the psychological dynamics between people and technology in an age when technology is increasingly redefining what it means to be human.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou’re at the frontier of research being done on computers and their effects on society. What has changed in the past few decades?\r\n\r\nTo be in computing in 1980, you had to be a computer scientist. But if you’re an architect now, you’re in computing. Physicians are in computing. Businesspeople are certainly in computing. In a way, we’re all in computing; that’s just inevitable. And this means that the power of the computer—with its gifts of simulation and visualization—to change our habits of thought extends across the culture.\r\n\r\nMy most recent work reflects that transformation. I have turned my attention from computer scientists to builders, designers, physicians, executives, and to people, generally, in their everyday lives. Computer software changes how architects think about buildings, surgeons about bodies, and CEOs about businesses. It also changes how teachers think about teaching and how their students think about learning. In all of these cases, the challenge is to deeply understand the personal effects of the technology in order to make it better serve our human purposes.\r\n\r\nA good example of such a challenge is the way we use PowerPoint presentation software, which was originally designed for business applications but which has become one of the most popular pieces of educational software. In my own observations of PowerPoint in the classroom, I’m left with many positive impressions. Just as it does in business settings, it helps some students organize their thoughts more effectively and serves as an excellent note-taking device. But as a thinking technology for elementary school children, it has limitations. It doesn’t encourage students to begin a conversation—rather, it encourages them to make points. It is designed to confer authority on the presenter, but giving a third or a fourth grader that sense of presumed authority is often counterproductive. The PowerPoint aesthetic of bullet points does not easily encourage the give-and-take of ideas, some of them messy and unformed. The opportunity here is to acknowledge that PowerPoint, like so many other computational technologies, is not just a tool but an evocative object that affects our habits of mind. We need to meet the challenge of using computers to develop the kinds of mind tools that will support the most appropriate and stimulating conversations possible in elementary and middle schools. But the simple importation of a technology perfectly designed for the sociology of the boardroom does not meet that challenge.\r\n\r\n“The Machine might say, ‘Mary, you are very tense this morning. It is not good for the organization for you to be doing X right now. Why don’t you try Y?’”\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a technology as simple as PowerPoint can raise such difficult questions, how are people going to cope with the really complex issues waiting for us down the road—questions that go far more to the heart of what we consider our specific rights and responsibilities as human beings? Would we want, for example, to replace a human being with a robot nanny? A robot nanny would be more interactive and stimulating than television, the technology that today serves as a caretaker stand-in for many children. Indeed, the robot nanny might be more interactive and stimulating than many human beings. Yet the idea of a child bonding with a robot that presents itself as a companion seems chilling.\r\n\r\nWe are ill prepared for the new psychological world we are creating. We make objects that are emotionally powerful; at the same time, we say things such as “technology is just a tool” that deny the power of our creations both on us as individuals and on our culture. At MIT, I began the Initiative on Technology and Self, in which we look into the ways technologies change our human identities. One of our ongoing activities, called the Evocative Objects seminar, looks at the emotional, cognitive, and philosophical power of the “objects of our lives.” Speakers present objects, often technical ones, with significant personal meaning. We have looked at manual typewriters, programming languages, hand pumps, e-mail, bicycle gears, software that morphs digital images, personal digital assistants—always focusing on what these objects have meant in people’s lives. What most of these objects have in common is that their designers saw them as “just tools” but their users experience them as carriers of meanings and ideas, even extensions of themselves.\r\n\r\nThe image of the nanny robot raises a question: Is such a robot capable of loving us?\r\n\r\nLet me turn that question around. In Spielberg’s AI, scientists build a humanoid robot, David, who is programmed to love. David expresses his love to a woman who has adopted him as her child. In the discussions that followed the release of the film, emphasis usually fell on the question of whether such a robot could really be developed. Was this technically feasible? And if it were feasible, how long would we have to wait for it? People thereby passed over another question, one that historically has contributed to our fascination with the computer’s burgeoning capabilities. The question is not what computers can do or what computers will be like in the future, but rather, what we will be like. What we need to ask is not whether robots will be able to love us but rather why we might love robots.\r\n\r\nSome things are already clear. We create robots in our own image, we connect with them easily, and then we become vulnerable to the emotional power of that connection. When I studied children and robots that were programmed to make eye contact and mimic body movements, the children’s responses were striking: When the robot made eye contact with the children, followed their gaze, and gestured toward them, they responded to the robot as if it were a sentient, and even caring, being. This was not surprising; evolution has clearly programmed us to respond to creatures that have these capabilities as though they were sentient. But it was more surprising that children responded in that way to very simple robots—like Furby, the little owl-like toy that learned to speak “Furbish” and to play simple games with children. So, for example, when I asked the question, “Do you think the Furby is alive?” children answered not in terms of what the Furby could do but in terms of how they felt about the Furby and how it might feel about them.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the so-called theory of object relations in psychoanalysis has always been about the relationships that people—or objects—have with one another. So it is somewhat ironic that I’m now trying to use the psychodynamic object-relations tradition to write about the relationships people have with objects in the everyday sense of the word. Social critic Christopher Lasch wrote that we live in a “culture of narcissism.” The narcissist’s classic problem involves loneliness and fear of intimacy. From that point of view, in the computer we have created a very powerful object, an object that offers the illusion of companionship without the demands of intimacy, an object that allows you to be a loner and yet never be alone. In this sense, computers add a new dimension to the power of the traditional teddy bear or security blanket.\r\n\r\nSo how exactly do the robot toys that you are describing differ from traditional toys?\r\n\r\nWell, if a child plays with a Raggedy Ann or a Barbie doll or a toy soldier, the child can use the doll to work through whatever is on his or her mind. Some days, the child might need the toy soldier to fight a battle; other days, the child might need the doll to sit quietly and serve as a confidante. Some days, Barbie gets to attend a tea party; other days, she needs to be punished. But even the relatively simple artificial creatures of today, such as Hasbro’s My Real Baby or Sony’s dog robot AIBO, give the appearance of having minds of their own, agendas of their own. You might say that they seem to have their own lives, psychologies, and needs. Indeed, for this reason, some children tire easily of the robots—they simply are not flexible enough to accommodate childhood fantasies. These children prefer to play with hand puppets and will choose simple robots over complicated ones. It was common for children to remark that they missed their Tamagotchis [a virtual pet circa 1997 that needed to be cleaned, fed, amused, and disciplined in order to grow] because although their more up-to-date robot toys were “smarter,” their Tamagotchis “needed” them more.\r\n\r\nIf we can relate to machines as psychological beings, do we have a moral responsibility to them?\r\n\r\nWhen people program a computer that develops some intelligence or social competency, they tend to feel as though they’ve nurtured it. And so, they often feel that they owe it something—some loyalty, some respect. Even when roboticists admit that they have not succeeded in building a machine that has consciousness, they can still feel that they don’t want their robot to be mistreated or tossed in the dustheap as though it were just a machine. Some owners of robots do not want them shut off unceremoniously, without a ritualized “good night.” Indeed, when given the chance, people wanted to “bury” their “dead” Tamagotchi in on-line Tamagotchi graveyards. So once again, I want to turn your question around. Instead of trying to get a “right” answer to the question of our moral responsibility to machines, we need to establish the boundaries at which our machines begin to have those competencies that allow them to tug at our emotions.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, I found one woman’s comment on AIBO, Sony’s dog robot, especially striking in terms of what it might augur for the future of person-machine relationships: “[AIBO] is better than a real dog…It won’t do dangerous things, and it won’t betray you…Also, it won’t die suddenly and make you feel very sad.” The possibilities of engaging emotionally with creatures that will not die, whose loss we will never need to face, presents dramatic questions. The sight of children and the elderly exchanging tenderness with robotic pets brings philosophy down to earth. In the end, the question is not whether children will come to love their toy robots more than their parents, but what will loving itself come to mean?\r\n\r\nWhat sort of relational technologies might a manager turn to?\r\n\r\nWe’ve already developed machines that can assess a person’s emotional state. So for example, a machine could measure a corporate vice president’s galvanic skin response, temperature, and degree of pupil dilation precisely and noninvasively. And then it might say, “Mary, you are very tense this morning. It is not good for the organization for you to be doing X right now. Why don’t you try Y?” This is the kind of thing that we are going to see in the business world because machines are so good at measuring certain kinds of emotional states. Many people try to hide their emotions from other people, but machines can’t be easily fooled by human dissembling.\r\n\r\nSo could machines take over specific managerial functions? For example, might it be better to be fired by a robot?\r\n\r\nWell, we need to draw lines between different kinds of functions, and they won’t be straight lines. We need to know what business functions can be better served by a machine. There are aspects of training that machines excel at—for example, providing information—but there are aspects of mentoring that are about encouragement and creating a relationship, so you might want to have another person in that role. Again, we learn about ourselves by thinking about where machines seem to fit and where they don’t. Most people would not want a machine to notify them of a death; there is a universal sense that such a moment is a sacred space that needs to be shared with another person who understands its meaning. Similarly, some people would argue that having a machine fire someone would show lack of respect. But others would argue that it might let the worker who is being fired save face.', 1, '06 May, 2025', 4, '06-May-25-opt-2-medium-shot-man-wearing-vr-glasses-scaled-9b8910.jpg'),
